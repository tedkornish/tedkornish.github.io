    <h1>Ted Kornish</h1>
    <p>Currently at <a href="https://argo.io">Argo</a> building tools that let nontechnical workers ask questions about big financial data.</p>
    <p>I've coarchitected and implemented:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>interactive visualization frameworks &mdash; abstracted on top of d3.js</li>
      <li>data synchronization architecture &mdash; for fetching, storing, and syncing relational data from remote APIs.</li>
      <li>streaming ETL &mdash; from Postgres through Golang to Elasticsearch.</li>
      <li>in-house compilers &mdash; for a custom query language with natural language search capabilities.</li>
      <li>interactive-latency querying over hundreds of millions of records &mdash; for ad-hoc questions about lots of data. Built on Redshift.</li>
    </ul>
