    <h1>Ted Kornish</h1>
    <p>Currently at Argo building tools that let nontechnical workers ask questions about big financial data.</p>
    <p>I've coarchitected and implemented:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>interactive visualization frameworks &mdash; abstracted on top of d3.js</li>
      <li>data synchronization architecture &mdash; for fetching, storing, and syncing relational data from remote APIs.</li>
      <li>eventually consistent data pipelines &mdash; streaming ETL from Postgres through Golang to Elasticsearch.</li>
      <li>in-house compilers &mdash; for a custom query language with natural language search capabilities.</li>
      <li>interactive-latency ad-hoc query capabilities over hundreds of millions of records &mdash; for asking question about lots of data, fast. Built on Redshift.</li>
    </ul>
